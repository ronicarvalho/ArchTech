## Name
ArchTech Building Blocks

## Description
Building blocks for .Net apis with Vertical Slice Architecture and use cases. According to the study topics covered, in addition to the Interactors and WebApi blocks, blocks for Kafka Stream and Workers were added, as well as a block for DDD based on the study of the book "Implementing Domain-Driven Design" by Vaughn Vernon. The DDD block was not included yet.

## Installation
Install the libraries into your project, considering the context of the library and the purpose of the application. See the samples to understand how use until this readme was updated. 

## Usage
There are example projects of use, but we deserve more attention on this point.

## Support
As it is a project created with a focus on studies, although applied to real projects, support is limited to open issues on github.

## Roadmap
The project was created for studies, so we have a roadmap but it is not written in stone.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute in any way, fell free. Open a fork, make your contribution and submit a pull request.

## Project status
This project is just the result of studying and sharing information with friends. Although made with the intention of being a fun time to study, we apply it to real projects efficiently.
